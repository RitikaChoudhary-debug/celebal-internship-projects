## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project implements an unsupervised machine learning solution for detecting anomalies in network traffic data. Leveraging the Isolation Forest algorithm, the platform identifies unusual patterns that could signify security breaches, system malfunctions, or other critical deviations from normal network behavior.

**Key Highlights:**
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Detects anomalies without requiring pre-labeled attack data for training.
* **Isolation Forest:** An efficient algorithm for anomaly detection, particularly effective in high-dimensional datasets.
* **Enhanced Feature Engineering:** Custom-engineered features derived from raw network attributes to provide richer, more discriminative information to the model.
* **Robust Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematic optimization of model parameters for improved performance.
* **Streamlit Web Application:** A user-friendly interface for interactive anomaly prediction.
* **Modular Codebase:** Organized into distinct Python modules for maintainability and scalability.

**Dataset:** KDD Cup 99 - A widely recognized benchmark dataset for intrusion detection systems.
